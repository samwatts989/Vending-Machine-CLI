# Vending-Machine-CLI

This vending machine does it all!*

- Takes a .txt file of inventory and reads it

- Displays the inventory items

- Allows the user to purchase those items

- Only allows the user to put in any amount of money they desire

- Only allows user to put in valid inputs

- Pulls a Big Brother and writes all interactions into a .txt file

- Even does a solid and returns change to the user (although I argued we should keep the users money as a tip for such a finely coded project)

- Let's the user exit the program (although... why would they want to? It's a beautiful program)

Hopefully someone out there finds this program and enjoys it!

* Okay, maybe not ALL but the list of things it does do is pretty impressive
